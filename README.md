## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

This sample application, no matter which API project you target, will requires the following to be installed/enabled on your machine:

* [MariaDB Client](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/clients/), used to connect to MariaDB instances.

## Introduction to MariaDB <a name="introduction"></a>

### MariaDB Platform <a name="platform"></a>

[MariaDB Platform](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform/) integrates the former [MariaDB TX (transactions)](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform-transactional/) and [MariaDB AX (analytics)](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform-analytical/) products so developers can build modern applications by enriching transactions with real-time analytics and historical data, creating insightful experiences and compelling opportunities for customers – and for businesses, endless ways to monetize data. It’s the only enterprise open source database built for modern applications running in the cloud.

</p>

To get started using MariaDB locally you can:

* [Download and install MariaDB (Community or Enterprise) directly from mariadb.com](https://mariadb.com/downloads) 

* [Download and install MariaDB using the official MariaDB Community Server 10.6 Docker Image available at hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)

### MariaDB SkySQL <a name="skysql">

[SkySQL](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/) is the first and only database-as-a-service (DBaaS) to bring the full power of MariaDB Platform to the cloud, including its support for transactional, analytical and hybrid workloads. Built on Kubernetes, and optimized for cloud infrastructure and services, SkySQL combines ease of use and self-service with enterprise reliability and world-class support – everything needed to safely run mission-critical databases in the cloud, and with enterprise governance.

### Using JSON in a relational database <a name="json-relational"></a>

[JSON](https://www.json.org) is fast becoming the standard format for data interchange and for unstructured data, and MariaDB Platform (in fact, all MariaDB versions 10.2 and later) include a range of [JSON supporting functions](https://mariadb.com/topic/json/).

The Places application uses only a **single table** for all location, and uses JSON to store more specific information based on the location type.

For more information on how JSON can be used within MariaDB please check out this [blog post](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/json-with-mariadb-10-2/)!

## Getting started <a name="getting-started"></a>

In order to run the Places application you will need to have a MariaDB instance to connect to. For more information please check out "[Get Started with MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/get-started-with-mariadb/)".

### Get the code <a name="code"></a>

Download this code directly or use [git](git-scm.org) (through CLI or a client) to retrieve the code using `git clone`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/dev-example-places.git
```

### Create the schema <a name="schema"></a>

[Connect to the database](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/connecting-to-mariadb/) using CLI or a client and execute the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `locations` (
  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `description` varchar(500) DEFAULT '',
  `type` char(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `latitude` decimal(9,6) NOT NULL,
  `longitude` decimal(9,6) NOT NULL,
  `attr` longtext CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin DEFAULT NULL CHECK (json_valid(`attr`)),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

### Anatomy of the app <a name="app"></a>

This application is made of two parts:

* Client
    - communicates with the API.
    - is a React.js project located in the [client](client) folder.
* API
    - uses a MariaDB Connector to connect to MariaDB.
    - contains multiple projects, located in the [api](api) folder.
        - [Node.js](api/nodejs)
        - [Python](api/python)

See the README's in [client](client/README.md) and [api](api/README.md) for more information on how to get started!

### Build and run the app <a name="build-run"></a>

   1. Nagivate to the [client](client) folder and execute the following CLI command before proceeding:

      ```
      $ npm install
      ```

   2. Configure the MariaDB connection by an [environmental](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (called `.env`) file within the `client` folder.

      ```
      $ touch .env
      ```

      Then add the key `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY` and a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

      ```
      REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=<google_api_key_here>
      ```

      **Note:** The `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY` environmental variable is used [here](client/src/components/MapContainer.js#L250).

   3. Pick an [API](api) project and follow the instructions of the README to build and run the API project.

   4. Navigate to the [client](client) folder and execute the following CLI command to start the React.js application.

      ```bash 
      $ npm start
      ``` 

   5. Open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## JSON Data Models <a name="data-models"></a>

   ]
}
